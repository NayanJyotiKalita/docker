# Running a Container with Resource Limits

Objective
Set up the nginx-resource-isolation container with defined CPU and memory limits to ensure it performs optimally under resource constraints.

Instructions
Deploy the nginx-resource-isolation container with the following resource limits:

CPU: 1.5 cores

Memory: 512 MB

Map the host port 8080 to the container port 80 so that the nginx server is accessible.

Verify that the container is running with the specified resource constraints and that nginx is accessible from the host.
