# Managing Docker Volumes

## Objective
You are tasked with managing Docker volumes in a Swarm environment. This exercise will help you understand how to create volumes, mount them in services, and verify volume usage.

### Instructions
Create a Docker volume named app_data.

Deploy a new service named app_service using the nginx image.

Mount the app_data volume to /usr/share/nginx/html inside the container.

Verify Volume Usage

List all running services to ensure app_service is deployed.

Inspect the app_data volume to confirm it is correctly attached to app_service.

Important Notes:
Ensure the Docker Swarm cluster is initialized before attempting this task.

Use volume inspection and service listing commands to verify correctness.

Expected Outcome:
A Docker volume named app_data exists.

The app_service service is running with the volume mounted to the correct path.

Verification commands show that the volume is properly attached to the service.
