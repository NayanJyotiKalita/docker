# Adding a Non-Root User to a Docker Image

Objective
Create a Docker image from openjdk:17-slim that runs all processes as a non-root user, ensuring improved security by avoiding the root account inside containers. Additionally, address the common ownership/permission issue that may prevent editing or writing the Dockerfile.

Tasks
Navigate to /home/user/assignment and create a Dockerfile.
Use openjdk:17-slim as the base image.
Add a new non-root user named user1 with a Bash shell.
Configure the container to run as user1 by setting it as the default user.
Define a command in the Dockerfile (whoami) to verify the container runs as user1.
Build the image with the name non-root-user-app.
Run a container named non-root-user-container from the built image (the container should exist and exit with code 0).
Verify through container logs that the application runs as user1.
Notes
Password for sudo : user@123!
If you face ownership or write permissions issues,change ownership of the directory
Run the container in detached mode (-d).Detached mode ensures that the container output can later be inspected using docker logs
Expected Outcome
The Dockerfile is correctly defined in /home/user/assignment.
The image non-root-user-app is successfully built.
The container non-root-user-container runs and outputs user1, confirming the process executes under the non-root user.
Ownership issues (if any) are resolved so that the Dockerfile can be created and modified without errors.
