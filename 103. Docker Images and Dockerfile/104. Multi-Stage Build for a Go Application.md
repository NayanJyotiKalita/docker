# Multi-Stage Build for a Go Application

## Task: Basic Multi-Stage Build for a Go Application
Use a pre-existing Go application (main.go) in /home/user/assignment that prints "Hello from Multi-Stage Build!". </br>
Write a multi-stage Dockerfile in /home/user/assignment. Build the Docker image named go-multi-stage-app and verify it works by running the container go-multi-stage-app

### Stage 1: Use the golang image to build the application.

To create a Docker image using a multi-stage build for a Go application, follow these concise steps to structure your Dockerfile effectively:
```
Use golang:1.20 as the base image for the builder stage.
Set WORKDIR to /app.
Copy main.go from your local directory to /app.
Build the Go binary named app by running go build -o app main.go.
```

### Stage 2: Use a minimal base image (e.g., alpine) to copy and run the binary.
```
Use alpine:latest as the base image for the runtime stage to keep the image size minimal.
Set WORKDIR to /root.
Copy the compiled binary app from the builder stage using COPY --from=builder /app/app
Specify ENTRYPOINT as ["./app"] to run the application when the container starts.
```
