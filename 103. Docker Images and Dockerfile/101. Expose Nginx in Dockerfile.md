# Expose Nginx in Dockerfile

## TASK - 1: Write a Dockerfile 
**Objective:** Create a Dockerfile in /home/user/assignment to use the official nginx:latest image, copy a static index.html file into the container, and expose port 80.

### Steps:
Use nginx:latest as the base image. </br>
Copy a local index.html that is located in /home/user/assignment into /usr/share/nginx/html/. </br>
Expose port 80 for the web server. </br>
This should be the content of index.html file </br>

Example index.html File: </br>
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Nginx Server</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Nginx Web Server!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

## TASK - 2: Build the Image
**Objective:** Build the Docker image named nginx-static-site from the Dockerfile. </br>

### Steps:
Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and index.html.

## TASK - 3: Run the Container
**Objective:** Start the container named nginx-static and verify the web server is running. The container should map port 80 inside to port 8080 on the host machine, 
allowing external access to the web server via port 8080. This is crucial for accessing the web server if the default port 80 on the host is already in use or inaccessible due to permissions.
