# Keeping a Container Running

### Objective: Use sleep to keep a container running for a specified amount of time.

***Scenario:*** You are tasked with creating a container that runs for a fixed duration of 120 seconds. This can be useful in scenarios where you need a temporary container to test certain configurations or debug issues.

## Tasks:
```
Create a Dockerfile in /home/user that:

Uses alpine:latest as the base image.

Specifies the command sleep 120 to keep the container running for 120 seconds.

Note: You are not required to set a working directory ( WORKDIR ) for this task as the sleep 
command does not depend on any specific directory structure.

Build the Docker image and tag it as sleep-container .

Run the container with it's name sleep-container-instance and verify:
It starts successfully and stays running for 120 seconds before stopping.
```

**Verification:**
Use docker ps to check if the container is running immediately after starting it. </br>
Wait for 120 seconds and use docker ps again to confirm the container has stopped.
