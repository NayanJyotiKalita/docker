# Manage and Scale Docker Stack

## Objective:
Learn how to manage the lifecycle of a Docker Stack by modifying service configurations, redeploying, and scaling. This exercise focuses on updating an image version within a stack and scaling a service to handle higher load.

### Instructions:

    1. Update the existing docker-compose.yml file at /home/user/docker-compose.yml by changing the web service’s 
    image from nginx:latest to nginx:alpine.

    2. Redeploy the stack named mystack with the updated configuration.

    3. Scale the service mystack_web to run 2 replicas.
