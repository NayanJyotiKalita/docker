Docker Stack

Objective:
Learn how to deploy and verify a Docker Stack in a Docker Swarm environment. This exercise will help you understand stack deployment, service verification, and capturing stack service information for auditing purposes.

Instructions:

    1. Initialize a Docker Swarm cluster on the lab machine.

    2. Deploy a Docker Stack named mystack using the pre-existing docker-compose.yml located at /home/user/docker-compose.yml.

    3. Verify that the services in the stack are running as expected.

    4. Capture the output of the stack services and save it to a file named stack_services_output.txt in your working directory.
