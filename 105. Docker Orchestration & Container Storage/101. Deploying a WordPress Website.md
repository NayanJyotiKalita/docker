# Deploying a WordPress Website

Objective:
Learn how to deploy a multi-service application using Docker Compose. In this exercise, you will set up a WordPress website with a MySQL database, ensuring data persistence and proper connectivity between services.

Instructions:
1. Use the provided environment to create a docker-compose.yml file that defines two services:

    - db: a MySQL 5.7 container with a named volume (db_data) for data persistence and appropriate environment variables for database credentials.

    - wordpress: a WordPress container configured to connect to the database, exposed on port 8000.

2. Deploy the stack using Docker Compose.

3. Verify:

    - The WordPress service is accessible on port 8000.

    - The MySQL database service is running on port 3306.

    - The named volume db_data is created for persistence.
