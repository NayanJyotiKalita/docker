# Docker Compose

Objective:
Learn how to use Docker Compose to define and run multi-container applications. This exercise focuses on creating a Compose file, deploying services, and verifying the deployment.

Instructions:

1. Create a docker-compose.yml file in your home directory that defines two services:

    - web: based on nginx:latest, exposed on port 80, and dependent on the db service.

    - db: based on redis:latest.

    - Both services should be attached to a custom bridge network named app-network.

2. Deploy the services using Docker Compose.

3. Verify that both services are running by listing them with Docker Compose.
